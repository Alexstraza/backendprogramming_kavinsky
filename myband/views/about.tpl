<h1>Who is Kavinsky?</h1>
<p>Kavinsky died in a car crash in 1986, whilst driving his beloved Testarossa. He re-appeared as a zombie in 2005, with his 12-inch, Teddy Boy. Since then, he has shown up all around the globe, playing his music to fellow humans. Crowds gathered to witness the miracle: despite being dead, Kavinsky was still alive.

    In 2007, he released his second 12-inch, 1986. This is when his French robot mates in Daft Punk invited him to join their Alive Tour, and A-Trak put together an American Tour in his now repaired Testarossa. After discovering the world with his red eyes, Kavinsky retreated to his base camp to work on his debut album.

    Now, the zombie is striking back. After months of studio work on his forthcoming album, he & Record Makers have decided to release 'Nightcall' as an aperitif. 'Nightcall' is the first song Kavinsky provides vocals for, a duet you might say, featuring the zombie and his girlfriend, a.k.a. Lovefoxxx from CSS!</p>
